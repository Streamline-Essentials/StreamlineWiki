# Introduction to Streamline

### What is Streamline?
`Streamline` or possibly known as `StreamlineCore` is a **Minecraft Java Edition** server plugin for both proxies *and* backend servers.

Things we call "`Modules`" allow your server to have vast capabilities through this `Core` plugin.

`Modules`, simply put, are plugins like that of your **Minecraft Server**'s plugins but for `StreamlineCore`. Think of it like a house: the `StreamlineCore` is the foundation to the house and things such as appliances or even rooms in the house are the `Modules`.

### What makes Streamline special?
`Streamline` allows for **universal cross-platform capabilities** with its `Modules`.

This essentially means you can <u>run the same modules on a BungeeCord proxy that you would on a Velocity proxy</u> (or even a Spigot or Paper backend server). This, coupled with the `Modularized` features means that **you**, the server admin, can choose *exactly* what you want in your server. 

This also makes it very simple for server `Owners` and `Administrators` to use a specific module **across their servers**, or even for `Developers` to **develop modules for your server** (or the community).

### What exactly is Streamline capable of?
Literally *anything*.

#### Supported Proxies:
> * Velocity
> * Bungeecord
> * Waterfall
> * Flamecord
> * Travertine

#### Supported Backend Servers
> * Spigot.
> * Paper.
> * Purpur.
> * Tuinity.

#### Natively-Supported Plugins.
> * Luckperms.
> * Geyser.
> * PlaceholderAPI.

#### Current Functionalities
- **Hypixel `Guild` and `Party` functionality** with the `StreamlineGroups` module.
- **Network-wide messaging** (whispering and replying) and `Local`, `Global`, or even `Custom` room chatting (yes, this includes staff chat, builder chat, etc.) with the `StreamlineMessaging` module.
- **Customizable and complete Discord integration** (supports both above modules as well!) with the StreamlineDiscord module.
- And **other utilities** with the `StreamlineUtilities` module.
