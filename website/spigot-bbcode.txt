Introduction to Streamline

[h3]What is Streamline?[/h3]
Streamline or possibly known as StreamlineCore is a Minecraft Java Edition server plugin for both proxies and backend servers.

Things we call "Modules" allow your server to have vast capabilities through this Core plugin.

Modules, simply put, are plugins (like those for your Minecraft Server) but for StreamlineCore. Think of it like a house: the StreamlineCore is the foundation to the house and the Modules are things such as appliances or even rooms in the house.

[h3]What makes Streamline special?[/h3]
Streamline allows for universal cross-platform capabilities with its Modules.

This essentially means you can run the same modules on a BungeeCord proxy that you would on a Velocity proxy (or even a Spigot or Paper backend server). This, coupled with the Modularized features means that you, the server admin, can choose exactly what you want in your server.

This also makes it very simple for server to use a specific module across your servers, or even for Developers to develop modules for your server (or the community).
