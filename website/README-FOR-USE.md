### How do I use this?
#### Installation
1. Stop your server.
2. Place the StreamlineAPI jar file in your server's `plugins` folder.
    1. If you are using Velocity or any forks of it: you want the Velocity jar.
    2. If you are using Bungeecord or any forks of it: you want the Bungee jar.
3. Start and then stop your server.
4. Fill out any configurations to your desire (located in the `plugins/streamlineapi` folder).
5. Put any desired modules in the `modules` folder (located in the `plugins/streamlineapi` folder).
   1. If you added any modules:
      1. Start and stop your server one more time.
      2. Fill out any configurations in the `modules` folder to your desire.
   2. If not, continue.
6. Start server.
7. Enjoy! :)

#### Modules
You might be wondering: what are modules? Simply put, modules are plugins for the Streamline plugin.
If I just lost you, then -- to put it another way -- modules are what makes Streamline useful.

So how do you get modules? Well, I (Quaintified) have made a few to help you out;
located [here](https://www.mediafire.com/folder/fmduksvzxqlcu/modules). But, anyone can make a
module. It just takes a little knowledge of Java.

... More will be added to this document later.

If you need any help, have questions, or suggestions; head over to the Streamline Discord,
